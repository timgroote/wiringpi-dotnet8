# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timgroote/wiringpi-dotnet8/master/logos/raspberryio-logo-32.png" alt="wiringpi-dotnet" style="width:16px; height:16px" />  A long overdue update to UnoSquare's WiringPi-dotnet

*:star: Please star this project if you find it useful!*

----------------

## IMPORTANT
please read.

Because Unosquare have retired their wiringpi project, this repository contains a consolidated collection of all packages needed to use GPIO from dotnet on a _64 bit_ OS on Raspberry Pi
And packages it so it can be used from dotnet 8.

It uses a recent version of the WiringPi library https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi
and comes with 64 bit bindings for WiringPi in its libwiringpi.so

I unfortunately do not have the time to take up maintaining wiringpi, but i rely on it for some projects.
Since the dotnet IOT libraries did not lead to much success, i have made this repository so i could keep using wiringpi in my dotnet projects.
In its current state, the library seems on par with where Unosquare left off.
HOWEVER i can not test if it is 100% functional. Your mileage may vary.

Provides complete managed access to the popular wiringpi C library

The default low-level provider is the wonderful ```WiringPi``` library available [here](http://wiringpi.com/). You do not need to install this library yourself. The ```Unosquare.WiringPi``` assembly will automatically extract the compiled binary of the library in the same path as the entry assembly.

## Installation

Install basic Raspberry.IO package:
[![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO)

```
PM> Install-Package Unosquare.Raspberry.IO
```

Install WiringPi implementation:
[![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Unosquare.wiringpi.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Unosquare.wiringpi)

```
PM> Install-Package Unosquare.WiringPi
```

## Obtaining Board and System Information
```RaspberryIO``` contains useful utilities to obtain information about the board it is running on. You can simply call the ```Pi.Info.ToString()``` method to obtain a dump of all system properties as a single ```string```, or you can use the individual properties such as Installed RAM, Processor Count, Raspberry Pi Version, Serial Number, etc. There's not a lot more to this.

Please note ```Pi.Info``` depends on ```Wiring Pi```, and the ```/proc/cpuinfo``` and ```/proc/meminfo``` files.

The above diagram shows the pins of GPIO Header P1. There is an additional GPIO header on the Pi called P5. [More info available here](http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/09/raspberry-pi-p5-header/)

In order to access the pins, use ```Pi.Gpio```. The pins can have multiple behaviors and fortunately ```Pi.Gpio``` can be iterated, addressed by index, addressed by BCM pin number and provides the pins as publicly accessible properties.

Here is an example of addressing the pins in all the various ways:

```csharp
public static void TestLedBlinking()
{
    // Get a reference to the pin you need to use.
    // All 3 methods below are exactly equivalent
    var blinkingPin = Pi.Gpio[17];
    blinkingPin = Pi.Gpio[BcmPin.Gpio17];
    blinkingPin = Pi.Gpio.Pin17;

    // Configure the pin as an output
    blinkingPin.PinMode = GpioPinDriveMode.Output;

    // perform writes to the pin by toggling the isOn variable
    var isOn = false;
    for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++)
    {
        isOn = !isOn;
        blinkingPin.Write(isOn);
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);
    }
}
```
